      "publication_summary": "The collection of publications demonstrates a strong focus on advancing sensing, signal processing, and machine learning methodologies for health monitoring, user authentication, activity recognition, and human-computer interaction, particularly leveraging wearable and earable devices. Several works introduce novel datasets and hardware platforms, such as the WF-PPG dataset for analyzing the impact of contact pressure on wrist and finger PPG morphology, and MEMS ultrasonic transducers for safe, low-power eye-blinking monitoring. Earable-based systems are extensively explored: SmarTeeth and BrushBuds utilize in-ear microphones and IMUs, respectively, to augment manual toothbrushing by tracking brushing locations and providing real-time feedback, while LR-Auth and related studies propose lightweight, non-invasive user authentication schemes based on unique acoustic signatures of the ear canal, achieving high accuracy and low system overhead suitable for resource-constrained earbuds. Heart rate and breathing monitoring are addressed through in-ear microphones and deep learning-based motion artifact mitigation, as in hEARt and BreathPro, enabling robust physiological monitoring even during physical activity. The research also extends to remote, multi-person heart rate monitoring using smart speakers, overcoming signal interference challenges in close-proximity scenarios. In the domain of low-power and embedded intelligence, frameworks like DiTMoS and UR2M introduce diverse tiny-model selection and uncertainty-aware event detection on microcontrollers, employing selector-classifier architectures, adversarial training, and evidential theory to balance accuracy, efficiency, and resource constraints. Energy harvesting is innovatively combined with sensing, as seen in SolarGest and SoLoc, which use photovoltaic cells for gesture recognition and indoor localization, and in piezoelectric insole prototypes for simultaneous gait recognition and energy harvesting, enhanced by LSTM-based temporal modeling. Privacy-preserving visualization techniques for mobile devices and deep-learning-based speech enhancement for earbuds (ClearSpeech) further highlight the integration of perceptual and signal processing insights. Large-scale field studies and machine learning analyses, such as those investigating depressive symptoms and mobility patterns among older adults, employ rich, multi-modal datasets and post-hoc model interpretation to inform health interventions. Collectively, these works exemplify the synergy between novel sensor modalities, data-driven algorithms, and application-driven system design, pushing the boundaries of wearable, earable, and mobile computing for personalized health, authentication, and interaction.",

      "publication_summary": "The collection of publications demonstrates a strong research focus on the development and deployment of advanced sensing, machine learning, and privacy-preserving techniques across diverse application domains, particularly in human-computer interaction, urban mobility, and mobile crowdsourcing. Notably, several works introduce novel event-based and neuromorphic camera systems for fine-grained, low-latency eye tracking (EyeTrAES, EyeGraph), leveraging adaptive event slicing, spatio-temporal graph clustering, and lightweight image processing to achieve high-fidelity pupil tracking and biometric authentication, validated on large-scale, in-the-wild datasets. In the domain of wearable and earable sensing, innovative systems such as BreathPro and the running gait monitoring platform utilize in-ear and out-ear microphones, combined with signal processing and machine learning, to unobtrusively detect breathing modes and foot strike patterns during running, achieving robust, real-time performance. Urban mobility research is advanced through data-driven optimization algorithms for bus scheduling (PASS and COST), predictive analytics platforms like BuScope that fuse individual and aggregate smart card data for live smart city services, and MetroWatch, which infers passenger travel paths from AFC data to estimate crowdedness. Mobile crowdsourcing is explored through the design, deployment, and behavioral analysis of platforms such as TA$Ker, with empirical studies on task recommendation strategies (push vs. pull), collaboration via peer referrals, and the impact of worker mobility uncertainty, using real-world datasets and field trials. Privacy and data protection are addressed through deep learning models for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (PrivObfNet), visual attention-based privacy risk prediction (PrivAttNet), and privacy-aware recommender and survey platforms (PrivacyCanary, Loki), which introduce adaptive obfuscation and user-controlled privacy-utility trade-offs, validated on large-scale image and recommendation datasets. Additionally, the research extends to privacy-preserving episodic memory support for older adults (PrivacyPrimer), balancing reminiscability and privacy in life-logging images. Collectively, these works are characterized by their methodological rigor, use of real-world and large-scale datasets, and the integration of novel algorithms and system designs to address concrete challenges in sensing, privacy, and user engagement across pervasive computing environments.",

Several works introduce innovative sensing modalities, such as 'cyberoception'—a smartphone-based, painlessly measurable proxy for interoception to enable emotion-aware computing—and HeartQuake, which uses bed-mounted geophones and deep learning (Bi-LSTM) for non-intrusive ECG waveform estimation. In the domain of mental health, machine learning models, particularly logistic regression, are applied to multi-modal datasets (demographics, activity logs, health indicators) to identify key predictors of depression among older adults, while large-scale GPS and WiFi data are analyzed to understand mobility patterns and their determinants in aging populations. The use of passive WiFi sensing is further explored for scalable sleep monitoring (SleepMore), contact tracing (WiFiTrace), and group behavior modeling (W4-Groups), with empirical validations on real-world datasets and advanced algorithms for uncertainty quantification and graph-based trajectory reconstruction. In physical activity monitoring, systems like W8-Scope and Annapurna employ sensor fusion (magnetic, accelerometer, IR, and smartwatch-based gesture/image recognition) and incremental learning to unobtrusively track gym exercises and eating behaviors, achieving high accuracy in diverse, longitudinal field studies. Cross-reality and augmented reality interfaces are advanced through interaction state-aware blending (GradualReality) and uncertainty-aware game design (Bubbleu), enhancing user experience by dynamically balancing immersion, transparency, and controllability. The integration of multi-modal data sources is exemplified in DenseTrack, which combines WiFi and video feeds using a novel CAIVU algorithm for real-time, device-agnostic tracking in ultra-dense indoor environments. Additional contributions include drone-based computer vision for swimmer performance analysis, deep learning-based speech enhancement for earbuds (ClearSpeech), and commodity RFID-based material identification and imaging (TagScan). Collectively, these works highlight a trend toward minimally invasive, scalable, and context-aware systems that bridge the gap between digital and physical worlds, with rigorous empirical validation and a focus on practical deployment in health, mobility, and social applications.",

Methodologically, the works employ user studies, Wizard of Oz experiments, psychophysical measurements, physiological sensing (e.g., EEG, ECG, EDA), and research through design to rigorously evaluate new interaction paradigms. In VR, several studies investigate hand redirection techniques, avatar embodiment, and visuo-haptic illusions, introducing toolkits like VoxelHap for constructing tactile proxies and pseudo-haptic methods for simulating resistance in object manipulation. The research also explores dual-purpose gestures for VR presentations and the impact of avatar completeness on user experience. In robotics, innovative instruction paradigms are proposed, such as direct image manipulation (ImageInThat) and in-situ demonstration recording (Mimic), with comparative studies showing improved user efficiency and preference over traditional methods. Embodied AI agents and generative AI for VR scene creation are examined, highlighting the importance of multimodal signaling and users' implicit expectations for conversational and spatial grounding. Wearable and fashion technology is explored both as a medium for personal and public storytelling—using annotated portfolios and design space analyses—and as a means to communicate affective states, as in garments simulating anxiety. Social computing research includes in-depth interviews with autistic Twitch streamers, revealing livestreaming as a platform for social connection, identity expression, and accessibility, and suggesting design opportunities for more inclusive platforms. Additional studies address collaborative exploration of 360° videos, artefact awareness in cross-reality workspaces, and the influence of media on flavor perception during eating. The collection also reflects on inclusivity in design pedagogy using the Digital Design Marginalization framework and analyzes learnability strategies in video games. Collectively, these works contribute novel methodologies, systems, and theoretical frameworks that bridge technical innovation with nuanced understanding of user experience, inclusivity, and social context.",

      "publication_summary": "The collection of publications presents a cohesive research agenda focused on advancing resource-efficient, context-aware, and privacy-respecting perception and interaction systems for pervasive and edge computing environments. Several works introduce novel frameworks and hardware prototypes that leverage multi-modal sensing—including RGB, LiDAR, and neuromorphic event cameras—to enable robust, low-latency, and energy-efficient perception tasks such as spatio-temporal video grounding, 3D localization, and fine-grained eye tracking. For instance, MIMIC and AIRFurn demonstrate AI- and AR-enhanced instruction comprehension using transformer-based language models, RGB+LiDAR fusion, and gesture-augmented segmentation, validated in immersive furniture shopping scenarios. Systems like Pr-Ge-Ne and MRIM propose deep generative and saliency-based mixed-resolution encoding techniques to drastically reduce video transmission and processing overheads on pervasive devices, while maintaining high accuracy. The LiLoc and DeLiDAR projects address precise 3D localization and LiDAR interference mitigation in dynamic indoor environments, employing multi-perspective point cloud registration, inertial sensor fusion, and innovative emitter-receiver decoupling. Canvas-based attention scheduling, as realized in JIGSAW, MOSAIC, and related works, introduces spatial multiplexing and dynamic region-of-interest bin-packing to maximize throughput and efficiency in multi-camera edge deployments, with empirical results on real-world datasets like CityflowV2 and license plate recognition. EyeTrAES and EyeGraph advance event-based eye tracking through adaptive event slicing, unsupervised spatio-temporal graph clustering, and the creation of large-scale, in-the-wild datasets, supporting both high-fidelity tracking and biometric authentication. Privacy and user-centricity are addressed in PA2BLO and the privacy-respecting service robots study, which propose low-power, on-device voice authentication and privacy preference elicitation mechanisms. The research also extends to collaborative edge perception, dynamic task allocation in crowdshipping, and empirically-driven control of building energy systems (OcAPO), each employing stochastic optimization, regression modeling, and real-world deployments to demonstrate practical gains. Across these works, the interplay between advanced DNN optimization, adaptive sensing, and system-level scheduling is consistently leveraged to balance accuracy, latency, energy, and user experience, with extensive experimental validation on platforms such as NVIDIA Jetson, Raspberry Pi, and AR smart glasses.",

      "publication_summary": "The collection of publications presents a diverse and technically advanced body of research focused on combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and quantum computing, with strong applications in logistics, transportation, urban services, and retail. Several works introduce novel solver-based and ensemble methods for training few-bit and binarized neural networks, such as the BeMi approach, leveraging mixed integer programming and multiobjective optimization to achieve robust, sparse, and accurate models for low-data scenarios, validated on datasets like MNIST and Fashion-MNIST. In maritime logistics, innovative frameworks are proposed for multi-ship collision avoidance using Nash bargaining and route exchange, as well as bi-objective dynamic tugboat scheduling that integrates Markov decision processes, mixed-integer programming, and approximate dynamic programming, achieving significant fuel and cost savings in real-world port operations. The research extends to last-mile and on-demand delivery, where learning-based and reinforcement learning (RL) methods—such as Neuro-Ins with attention mechanisms and position embeddings, and multi-agent RL for dispatch interval optimization—demonstrate superior performance over traditional heuristics on both synthetic and real datasets. Quantum computing is explored through feasibility-preserved quantum approximate solvers for capacitated vehicle routing, quantum-enhanced simulation-based optimization for Newsvendor problems, and hybrid quantum-classical approaches for multi-knapsack and permutation-based problems, employing techniques like QAOA, QRAO, and data-driven multi-start to address feasibility and scalability. In urban and retail analytics, data-driven and big data approaches augment classical models (e.g., Huff Model) with mobility and road network data, and automated facility location is optimized using ALNS variants enriched with community detection and population weighting. The research also addresses complex vehicle routing and scheduling under real-world constraints—such as LIFO loading, location congestion, and multi-party coordination—using hierarchical optimization, iterative best response, and stochastic programming. In public safety, multi-agent and deep RL methods, including APPO and MAVFA, are developed for dynamic police patrol scheduling and rescheduling, with frameworks like OFFICERS leveraging spatio-temporal deep learning (ST-ResNet) and scalable optimization for incident prediction and resource deployment. Across these domains, the studies emphasize the integration of advanced algorithmic techniques, real-world data, and domain-specific constraints, yielding scalable, robust, and operationally effective solutions that outperform existing benchmarks and commercial systems.",

Notably, several works introduce novel neural architectures—such as KG2ART for relation prediction in knowledge graphs, which eschews traditional representation learning in favor of bidirectional self-organizing inference, and FedART, which integrates federated learning with Adaptive Resonance Theory to support both classification and clustering on heterogeneous client data without parameter averaging. In reinforcement learning, the Iota explicit context representation (IECR) framework and its suite of algorithms leverage contextual key frames to enhance learning efficiency in discrete environments, while HiSOMA introduces a hierarchical multi-agent model where self-organizing neural networks modulate deep reinforcement learning controllers for long-horizon, multi-task decision-making. The STEM-ADL and FedSTEM-ADL models advance spatial-temporal episodic memory modeling for predicting activities of daily living (ADLs), with the latter employing federated learning to preserve user privacy across real-world datasets. In the area of explainability, spatio-temporal neural network models are developed to abstract and interpret multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) strategies, validated on benchmarks like StarCraft Multi-agent Challenge (SMAC). For knowledge graph refinement, both a comprehensive survey and novel machine learning approaches are presented, including methods for subgoal discovery and path planning (LSGVP, LIDOSS) that utilize value-based heuristics and integrated subgoal discovery to improve long-horizon goal achievement. In natural language processing, MiMuSA and MSRL-Net introduce explainable and relation-enhanced architectures for fine-grained sentiment analysis and aspect-based sentiment analysis, respectively, while GCN-EGTS leverages syntactic constituency parsing and commonsense knowledge graphs for aspect sentiment triplet extraction. The research also addresses real-world challenges: predictive self-organizing neural networks (fuzzy ARAM) and machine learning models are applied to in-home sensor data for early detection of mild cognitive impairment, with robust handling of small and noisy datasets; STEM-COVID employs spatio-temporal episodic memory for identifying asymptomatic COVID-19 cases from contact tracing data; and EVES utilizes multimodal deep reinforcement learning with EEG signals for emotion-based video summarization. Additional contributions include real-time hierarchical map segmentation for multi-robot exploration, vision-based topological mapping with self-organizing networks, and the introduction of new benchmarks such as MOSMAC for evaluating MARL algorithms on long-horizon, multi-objective tasks. Across these works, the interplay between novel neural architectures, advanced learning paradigms, and real-world data sources is emphasized, with a strong focus on interpretability, efficiency, and applicability to complex, heterogeneous environments.",

      "publication_summary": "The collection of publications delves into nuanced aspects of consumer behavior, technology adoption, and marketing strategies, with a strong emphasis on empirical methodologies and cross-cultural perspectives. Several studies employ advanced modeling techniques, such as multinomial and logit models, to analyze individual-level purchase data in multi-generational technological product markets, particularly focusing on the dynamics of initial and repeat purchases, leap-frogging behavior, and the influence of technological expectations among SOHO professionals. Research on product form preferences and technology convergence leverages experimental designs to reveal how modularity, lifecycle stages, and preannouncements of future technologies shape consumer choices between converged and dedicated products. The impact of product labeling—subordinate versus superordinate—on value perception and upgrade intentions is explored through multi-study experimental frameworks, while the fantasy realization model is innovatively adapted to marketing to examine how mental contrasting and indulging affect product replacement decisions under varying conditions of attribute novelty and obsolescence. Cross-device online search behavior is mapped using panel clickstream data, entropy-based metrics, and topic modeling, uncovering device-specific patterns in the purchase decision process. Studies on word-of-mouth transmission extend traditional dyadic models to triadic group settings, highlighting the roles of social ties and motivational orientations in shaping opinion dynamics. The influence of language and writing systems is investigated through experiments comparing auditory and visual brand identifier integration in Chinese and English, as well as cognitive processing differences in Korean Hancha and Hangul scripts. Organizational research addresses the intraorganizational diffusion of innovations, the utilization of business technologies (with CRM system data), and the mediating role of innovation in the market orientation–performance relationship, using both survey and industry data. Cultural and socio-economic factors are integrated into models of durable consumption and brand extension strategies, with comparative studies between Korean, U.S., and Hong Kong consumers revealing how cultural values and corporate identity cues modulate product perceptions and replacement cycles. Collectively, these works advance the field by combining rigorous quantitative and experimental methodologies with contextually rich, cross-cultural, and application-specific insights.",

Several works address food-related tasks, such as OSCAR, which leverages large language and vision-language models to provide object status tracking and contextual feedback for non-visual cooking, evaluated on YouTube and real-world cooking videos, and contributes a new annotated dataset. Food recognition and retrieval are further explored through the introduction of new benchmarks (DailyFood-172, DailyFood-16) to bridge the domain gap between curated and real-world food images, and methods like Multi-Cluster Reference Learning (MCRL) and Data Augmented Retrieval (DAR) that utilize foundation models (Llama2, SAM) for cross-modal representation learning. Cross-lingual and cross-domain adaptation for recipe retrieval is tackled with novel mixup strategies and partial data transfer learning, addressing the scarcity of paired data across cuisines and languages. Generative models are innovatively applied, as seen in AIFiligree, which uses AI-generated content to accelerate and diversify filigree art design, and Hand1000, which achieves anatomically accurate hand image synthesis from text with minimal data by integrating gesture recognition and advanced captioning. In the realm of video understanding, methods like RAGG introduce retrieval-augmented diffusion and progressive refinement for intent-based grasp generation, while active object segmentation and the EPIC-KITCHENS VISOR benchmark push the boundaries of egocentric action recognition and object segmentation with large-scale, richly annotated datasets. Video retrieval and editing are enhanced through student-teacher networks and efficient annotation strategies, and unsupervised video hashing is advanced with lightweight MLP-based models and multi-granularity contextualization for fast, accurate retrieval. Depression analysis is approached with MultiDepNet, a multimodal interpretable system fusing visual, physiological, audio, and textual data, with modality-specific feature extraction and interpretability mechanisms. Other notable contributions include emotionally intelligent fashion design using CNN and GAN architectures, person-level action recognition in surveillance via TSD-TSM networks, and causality-driven text-to-image synthesis for cooking scenarios with CookGAN.

Several studies focus on the quantification and enhancement of urban cooling effects, such as the 'Park Cool Island' phenomenon in Singapore, where dense networks of meteorological sensors and modified indices are used to spatially resolve radiative cooling in relation to vegetation and urban morphology. Complementary simulation-based research employs ENVI-met and Combined Spatial-Climatic Design approaches to assess how building geometry and density influence outdoor thermal comfort in tropical cities, providing actionable design recommendations. The role of urban greenery is further dissected through mechanistic ecohydrological models (e.g., Urban Tethys-Chloris) and numerical experiments that partition the effects of radiation, evapotranspiration, and aerodynamic roughness, revealing nuanced diurnal and seasonal cooling patterns across diverse climates. Field studies in European forests and peri-urban environments combine microclimate sensors, physiological measurements, and psychological surveys to demonstrate the synergistic benefits of biodiversity-rich forests on both thermal comfort and mental wellbeing, while also elucidating the structural attributes that maximize cooling. At finer spatial scales, high-resolution thermal imaging during heatwaves in Adelaide quantifies the substantial cooling provided by small vegetated patches, especially in residential settings. The integration of social media analytics, such as sentiment analysis of weather-related tweets, offers innovative, real-time proxies for public heat stress and discomfort in cities like Singapore and Phoenix. Wearable sensor technology is advanced through Project Coolbit, which demonstrates the feasibility of wrist-mounted devices for continuous, non-invasive monitoring of environmental and physiological parameters, enabling city-scale mapping of heat exposure and its behavioral impacts. Urban overheating and its health, energy, and economic ramifications are addressed through comprehensive, interdisciplinary assessments that bridge climatology, urban design, and governance, while also identifying adaptive capacities and vulnerabilities. The decarbonization of digital infrastructure, particularly data centers, is critically examined using mixed-methods research to highlight the technological, regulatory, and operational challenges in aligning urban digitization with sustainability and climate resilience. Large-scale, harmonized urban flux tower datasets are made openly available to support model evaluation and synthesis studies across diverse urban environments. In the context of the Indian Himalaya, long-term trend analyses and logistic regression-based susceptibility mapping elucidate the climatic and physical drivers of extreme rainfall and landslides, with implications for hazard mitigation. Remote sensing studies in Yangon, Myanmar, reveal complex, temporally variable relationships between land use/cover and land surface temperature, challenging conventional urban heat island paradigms and underscoring the influence of agriculture and water bodies. Collectively, these works advance the understanding of urban climate processes, mitigation strategies, and human adaptation through methodological innovation, cross-disciplinary integration, and the deployment of novel data sources.",

In the domain of multimodal perception, AMMPE and a LiDAR-vision fusion network address robust human pose estimation and place recognition by introducing new benchmarks (MMPD) and adaptive feature weighting, respectively, demonstrating superior performance across visible, infrared, and BEV modalities. In medical imaging, Swin-U2 Net integrates nested dual UNet architectures with Swin Transformers for precise and efficient teeth segmentation from dental X-rays, while transformer-based and deep learning approaches are also applied to 3D dental biometrics for pose-invariant arch extraction and matching, significantly improving identification speed and accuracy. Additional dental identification methods leverage signed feature histograms, improved spin images, and partial shape matching algorithms to robustly match complete and incomplete 3D tooth models, with applications in forensics and anthropology. In cybersecurity, systems for analyzing CVE records and crawling malware-related data are developed using Python, enabling trend analysis, vendor/product vulnerability tracking, and graphical data representation to inform risk management and ransomware mitigation. For lensless imaging, a phase congruency perception model is proposed to construct perceptually motivated loss functions, enhancing image reconstruction quality from encoded data. In additive manufacturing, a machine learning-integrated design framework is introduced to model complex structure-property relationships, exemplified by the design of customized ankle braces with tunable stiffness. Across these works, the research demonstrates a strong emphasis on novel algorithmic design, integration of deep learning and transformer models, creation of new datasets and benchmarks, and practical applications in autonomous driving, medical diagnostics, digital forensics, and industrial design.",

Several studies focus on the operational intricacies of ride-sourcing and on-demand delivery platforms, employing advanced methodologies such as stochastic programming, survival analysis, mixed-integer programming, and machine learning. For instance, novel frameworks are developed for real-time risk monitoring in intensive care units by integrating uncertainty quantification into SOFA scores, leveraging machine learning on large clinical datasets to improve mortality and readmission predictions. In the context of ride-sourcing, research introduces two-period stochastic models and greedy approximation algorithms to optimize order dispatching and pricing while accounting for service cancellations, revealing nuanced effects of linear and nonlinear pricing on matching probabilities and platform rewards. Complementary work uses two-stage survival analysis with Heckman correction to dissect order cancellation dynamics in on-demand food delivery, uncovering reference-dependent waiting behaviors and the impact of delivery fees and driver familiarity. Analytical models for food delivery further examine the effects of service region sizing, order bundling, and area optimization, employing discrete choice models, machine learning for delivery time prediction, and mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming to balance customer waiting times and order throughput. Studies on last-mile transportation systems and airport slot allocation introduce fairness constraints and stochastic optimization, respectively, using real public transport and aviation data to inform pricing, service priority, and capacity decisions. The research also delves into psychological and behavioral aspects, such as the last digit tendency in mobile transactions and merchants’ willingness to wait in white-label delivery, utilizing large-scale transaction data and non-parametric survival models to reveal underlying emotional and operational mechanisms. Multiobjective stochastic optimization and aggregate matching models are proposed for real-time ride-matching, balancing platform revenue, driver service quality, and passenger experience, and validated with both synthetic and real-world datasets. Additional contributions include bi-level optimization for regulatory policy in integrated ride-sourcing and vehicle rental markets, chance-constrained slot allocation for multiple-airport systems under flying time uncertainty, and path-choice-constrained bus bridging design for urban rail disruptions, each employing sophisticated mathematical programming and scenario-based analysis. Theoretical and empirical studies on ride-pooling, supply-demand equilibrium, and driver multi-homing behaviors further enrich the understanding of platform economics, labor supply elasticity, and the interplay between profit maximization and social welfare. Collectively, these works advance the state-of-the-art in modeling, optimization, and analytics for transportation-enabled urban services, offering actionable insights for platform operators, regulators, and service designers.",

      "publication_summary": "The collection of studies presents a multifaceted exploration of health policy, healthcare delivery, and behavioral interventions, employing rigorous empirical methodologies and diverse data sources. One study utilizes a randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of information nudges—specifically, accurate weight status feedback and biweekly digital reminders—on weight perception and dietary behavior, revealing sustained improvements in dietary choices among individuals with initial weight misperception, though limited effects on physical activity. Another investigation leverages prescription opioid order data to compare opioid dispensing patterns between independent and chain retail pharmacies, finding that independent pharmacies dispense significantly more opioids, with ownership transitions and competitive pressures influencing these patterns; the study further exploits the OxyContin reformulation as a natural experiment to disentangle nonmedical demand. The effects of primary care physician retirement are examined through an event study model using Medicare data, uncovering increased healthcare costs and chronic condition detection post-retirement, with heterogeneity based on practice type, state notification policies, and local provider shortages. The short-term economic impact of COVID-19 is analyzed using individual-level panel data from Singapore, demonstrating a sharp decline in household consumption—especially among wealthier households—driven by lockdowns and uncertainty, followed by a rapid rebound as restrictions eased. Pharmaceutical innovation in China is studied through patent data in the context of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme, showing that expanded rural health insurance coverage incentivizes innovation for diseases prevalent in rural areas. Two studies focus on Medicare observation stays: one uses comprehensive claims data to compare clinical outcomes and characteristics of patients with long versus short observation stays, supporting the rationale behind the Two-Midnight Rule but advocating for policy refinement based on actual stay length; the other employs linear probability models and propensity-score matching to reveal racial and geographic disparities in observation stay use and outcomes, highlighting persistent inequities. Finally, the relationship between hospital-SNF referral linkages and surgical readmissions is investigated using national Medicare data and instrumental variable analysis, demonstrating that stronger referral linkages significantly reduce 30-day readmission rates for major surgeries, with implications for risk-based reimbursement models. Collectively, these studies advance understanding of how targeted interventions, policy changes, and healthcare system structures influence patient outcomes, provider behavior, and innovation, often leveraging natural experiments, administrative datasets, and advanced econometric techniques.",

Several studies advance the integration of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and drones into EMS, specifically targeting opioid overdose interventions. These works employ Markov decision process (MDP) models and approximate dynamic programming, including neural network-based value function approximations and ad-hoc state aggregation, to address the high-dimensional and stochastic nature of real-time dispatch and redeployment decisions. Simulation studies, often leveraging real EMS data from regions such as Indiana and rural United States, demonstrate that these intelligent, data-driven policies outperform traditional rule-based approaches, especially under resource constraints and high demand. In parallel, research on interpretable machine learning for hospital readmission prediction introduces a two-step Extracted Regression Tree methodology, where a black box model is first trained and then distilled into an interpretable regression tree, validated on data from a large Asian teaching hospital. This approach achieves accuracy comparable to neural networks while providing actionable medical insights, thus enhancing clinical trust. Additionally, two publications investigate the operational dynamics of healthcare alliances between general hospitals and community healthcare centers in China, utilizing two-stage game-theoretic models and simulation to design and evaluate capacity allocation and revenue-sharing mechanisms. These studies reveal that negotiated revenue-sharing schemes and coordinated capacity decisions can achieve system-wide efficiency equivalent to centralized management, offering practical guidance for balancing patient flow and improving alliance performance.

In high-energy physics, multiple studies leverage large datasets from the ALEPH detector at LEP and other LEP experiments, focusing on precision electroweak measurements, such as the determination of the W and Z boson masses, widths, and couplings, as well as the effective electroweak mixing angle using jet charge measurements in hadronic Z decays. These works employ sophisticated statistical analyses of millions of collision events, including cross-section and asymmetry measurements, to test the Standard Model and constrain new physics scenarios like leptoquarks, contact interactions, and invisible Higgs decays. Methodologies include model-independent analyses, detailed studies of jet and particle production (e.g., charm and strange mesons, baryons, and tau decays), and the use of radiative return events for precise energy calibration. Notably, several studies set stringent limits on Higgs boson properties and search for rare or exotic decay channels, while others analyze event topologies such as four-jet final states and transverse momentum correlations to probe QCD dynamics and hadronization models. In parallel, the BCI-focused research introduces novel signal processing and machine learning techniques—such as Support Vector Machines, Hidden Markov Models, and RBF feature selection—for robust classification of EEG and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) signals. These studies demonstrate high-accuracy, real-time BCI speller applications for communication by severely disabled individuals, optimizing system parameters to reduce training time and improve usability. The research also explores the impact of artifact removal on classification accuracy and proposes innovative stimulus paradigms to enhance information transfer rates. Additionally, the collection includes theoretical work on perceptual effects in relativity and astrophysics, proposing cognitive models that reinterpret phenomena like gamma ray bursts and radio sources through the lens of sensory limitations and coordinate transformations. Across all domains, the publications are characterized by rigorous data-driven methodologies, the development of new metrics and algorithms, and the pursuit of both fundamental understanding and practical applications.",

Several studies focus on the Medicare Advantage (MA) capitation program, revealing through difference-in-difference designs and game-theoretical modeling—using data from over two million enrollees—that strategic cross-subsidization and risk selection persist even with perfect risk adjustment, challenging the assumption that big data alone can resolve these systemic issues. These works not only document previously unrecognized illegal practices in MA but also propose mechanisms to address cross-subsidization-induced risk selection, emphasizing the need for policy reforms and greater transparency in claims data. Complementing this, research on Medicaid enrollees leverages cross-sectional analyses and social network methodologies with Medicaid Analytic eXtract files to develop novel measures of chronic condition continuity (CCC) and to map physician network structures. These studies demonstrate that higher CCC and robust primary-specialty care coordination are associated with significantly reduced emergency department visits and hospitalizations, highlighting the nuanced interplay between care continuity, network centrality, and patient outcomes. In the public health domain, two longitudinal and instrumental variable studies utilize county-level data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, National Household Travel Survey, and National Transit Database to causally link increased public transit usage to reductions in obesity rates, rigorously controlling for confounders and selection bias. Collectively, these publications advance the understanding of how strategic behaviors, network structures, and policy interventions shape health outcomes, offering novel empirical evidence and actionable insights for healthcare management and public health policy.",

      "publication_summary": "The collection of publications presents a multifaceted investigation into the interplay between economic shocks, health, subjective well-being, and policy interventions across diverse contexts, with a strong empirical foundation in large-scale panel data, randomized controlled trials, and quasi-experimental designs. Several studies leverage long-term panel data from South Korea and Singapore to dissect the differential impacts of permanent versus transitory income shocks on life satisfaction and consumption, revealing that persistent income losses deeply affect well-being, while transitory gains, such as lottery winnings, elicit strong but short-lived consumption responses, especially among liquidity-constrained households. The use of lottery data in Singapore further enables causal inference on the effects of income on health and happiness, correcting for previously unobserved biases in the literature. Healthcare reforms and cost-sharing policies are rigorously evaluated using difference-in-regression-discontinuities and difference-in-differences approaches, uncovering nuanced effects on healthcare utilization, financial risk protection, and efficiency, particularly among adolescents and low-income groups. The COVID-19 pandemic serves as a natural experiment to assess the short- and long-term effects of lockdowns and targeted interventions on consumption, healthcare utilization, and life satisfaction, with findings indicating substantial but reversible declines in spending and well-being, and highlighting the role of income loss and personality traits in adaptation. Studies on health insurance reforms in the US and Singapore demonstrate improvements in subjective well-being and health outcomes, emphasizing the psychological benefits of coverage. The research also delves into the socioeconomic-health gradient, showing that health shocks have disparate labor market consequences by education level, and that early access to pension wealth can improve self-reported health. Methodologically, the works employ innovative field and survey experiments to test behavioral interventions, such as information nudges for weight management and fact-checking to correct misperceptions about immigrants, revealing both the potential and limitations of such strategies due to attention costs and behavioral inertia. Additional analyses explore the long-term health effects of early-life adversity and fetal malnutrition, the moderating role of social support on depression among older adults with chronic conditions, and the influence of local information and social capital on housing market responses to crime risk. Collectively, these studies advance understanding of how targeted policies, information interventions, and social structures mediate the effects of economic and health shocks, with robust evidence drawn from diverse populations and sophisticated empirical methodologies.",

      "publication_summary": "The collection of publications presents a comprehensive and technically nuanced exploration of advanced methods, models, and frameworks at the intersection of software engineering, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. A significant research direction is the application and adaptation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for software engineering tasks, including vulnerability detection and repair, autonomous multi-agent systems for software project management, and the development of efficient and environmentally sustainable LLM-based tools. Systematic literature reviews and empirical studies synthesize the state-of-the-art, categorize LLM adaptation techniques, and identify research gaps, particularly in areas such as test generation, code completion, and sentiment analysis within software engineering datasets. Novel methodologies are introduced, such as BRMiner, which combines LLMs with traditional input extraction to enhance automated test case generation from bug reports, and FlexFL, a two-stage open-source LLM-based framework for flexible and privacy-preserving fault localization. The research also addresses the robustness of transformer-based code intelligence models under semantic-preserving code transformations, and proposes new architectures and evaluation strategies for LLM-integrated systems, validated across domains like computer vision and coding. In the domain of software quality and testing, innovative approaches such as DeepVec for RNN test case selection, NSGen for neuron semantic-guided DNN fuzzing, and B4 for optimal code solution assessment with plausible tests are proposed, each leveraging deep learning, uncertainty metrics, or Bayesian frameworks to improve efficiency, interpretability, and fault detection. The studies extend to practical applications, including real-time drone misconfiguration rectification (Nyctea and ConFix), prioritization of speech test cases for ASR systems (Prophet), and Android malware detection using novel app representations (DexRay and DexBERT). Community and human factors are also examined, with comparative analyses of open-source deep learning framework communities (PyTorch vs. TensorFlow), explainable models for measuring software engineer contributions (Memento), and the impact of developer prompts on code completion productivity. In the security domain, symbolic execution tools like DeFiDefender are developed for detecting decentralized financial traps in Ethereum smart contracts, demonstrating high accuracy and scalability. Across these works, the integration of advanced machine learning models, empirical evaluation on large-scale and diverse datasets (e.g., Defects4J, GitHub, CIFAR, ImageNet, Ethereum smart contracts), and the design of explainable, efficient, and robust systems are recurrent themes, with each study contributing novel techniques, empirical insights, and actionable roadmaps for future research in software engineering and related fields.",

      "publication_summary": "The collection of publications demonstrates a multifaceted research focus on legal education, international law, and urban transport policy, each employing distinct methodologies and addressing specific application domains. One study investigates the use of Kahoot, a game-based learning application, to implement differentiated instruction for working adult law students at a Singapore university. Through literature review, critical examination of differentiated instruction's limitations, and practical application in tort and evidence law classes, the research highlights how interactive multiple-choice questions and active learner engagement can bridge learning gaps among adult learners with diverse abilities. In the realm of international law, two papers critically analyze ASEAN's legal practices: one responds to arguments about ASEAN's capacity to conclude treaties on behalf of its Member States, emphasizing the technical and conceptual distinctions between treaties and Memoranda of Understanding, and the necessity of grounding ASEAN's treaty practice in the consent articulated in the ASEAN Charter. Another article scrutinizes the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC), focusing on the accession of Australia and the USA, and reveals how these non-ASEAN states interpret the TAC's non-intervention provisions differently, attempting to reshape the treaty's core meaning to align with their own positions. In urban transport research, a study based on household survey data in Singapore applies binary logit and discrete choice models to quantify the income and cost elasticities of car ownership and transport mode choice. The findings inform policy recommendations such as reducing vehicle population growth rates, expanding bus priority lanes, and implementing congestion pricing, with the value of travel time savings calculated as a key parameter. Collectively, these works showcase the application of empirical modeling, doctrinal legal analysis, and educational technology to address nuanced challenges in their respective fields, with a strong emphasis on context-specific data and the interplay between theoretical frameworks and practical interventions.",

Several works focus on Android app debloating, introducing frameworks such as MiniAppPerm, MiniMon, and AutoDebloater, which leverage partial call graph construction, intelligent log-based generalization, and user-driven activity selection to efficiently remove unnecessary app features, thereby reducing attack surfaces and resource consumption. In the domain of sensitive behavior monitoring and side-channel analysis, CacheAlarm and ANDROSCOPE exploit CPU cache side channels for app behavior surveillance and sandbox integrity attacks, while another study demonstrates graphics interrupt-based side-channel attacks on GPUs, proposing mitigation via interrupt noise injection. Deep learning is harnessed in multiple contexts: for function signature inference in binaries (ReSIL), sensitive behavior detection in Android-powered cyber-physical systems, and in exposing vulnerabilities in AI-based malware detectors due to feature sparsity, with proposed defenses like subspace compression. Binary analysis research is advanced through hybrid static-dynamic approaches (TypeSqueezer) for function signature recovery, alignment padding-based compiler provenance recovery (BinAlign), and chosen-instruction attacks against commercial code virtualization obfuscators, which extract instruction mapping rules to aid deobfuscation. Security analysis of Android apps is furthered by MtdScout, a method-level clone detection tool that generates bytecode signatures to identify insecure methods missed by traditional taint and library detection tools, and by large-scale studies on custom permission misconfigurations and the usability security of in-app browsing interfaces. The effectiveness and limitations of repackage-proofing schemes are scrutinized, with proposals for robust frameworks leveraging runtime integrity metrics and obfuscation based on the Collatz conjecture. BackDroid introduces a targeted, on-the-fly bytecode search for efficient inter-procedural analysis of security-sensitive flows, outperforming traditional whole-app analysis tools. Additionally, user-centric studies investigate social support systems for older adults' mobile safety and fine-grained, root-free permission control at the UI widget level (UIPDroid). Collectively, these works demonstrate a strong interplay between advanced program analysis, machine learning, side-channel exploitation, and user-centered security design, validated through large-scale datasets, controlled experiments, and real-world app evaluations.",

Several works focus on big graph analytics, introducing systems like GraphMP and GraphH that leverage novel computation models—such as vertex-centric sliding windows and Gather-Apply-Broadcast—to minimize disk I/O and optimize memory usage, enabling high-performance processing on single machines or small clusters. In the domain of distributed machine learning, solutions like FC² and Dorm automate resource configuration and dynamic partitioning in cloud clusters, employing recommendation engines and container-based virtualization to balance cost, resource utilization, and fairness, while Timed Dataflow (TDF) reduces network communication overhead through parameter and gradient filtering. Security in cloud environments is addressed through innovative VM placement algorithms, including Group Instance and Previously Co-Located Users First, which utilize real-world cloud traces and optimization techniques (e.g., graph coloring, bin packing, genetic algorithms) to mitigate co-location and side-channel attacks without compromising resource efficiency. User-centric approaches for secure VM provisioning and open markets for trading idle resources (OMTiR) further enhance flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Application-specific platforms such as Hysia facilitate deep learning-based video-to-retail services by integrating GPU-optimized backends and orchestration layers, while BlockAgent pioneers decentralized air traffic flow management using blockchain-based multi-agent reinforcement learning. In simulation and virtual environment management, adaptive resource provisioning mechanisms (e.g., ArmVee), multi-objective zone mapping, and interactivity-constrained server provisioning employ metaheuristics, neural networks, and approximation algorithms to optimize performance, interactivity, and resource allocation, validated through extensive experiments with real-world datasets, cloud platforms, and large-scale deployments (e.g., PlanetLab, LHC Grid traces).

Several works focus on the transformative potential and regulatory complexities of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), especially the e-CNY, analyzing their environmental impacts, governance challenges, and implications for the international financial system through adaptive governance frameworks and case studies. The research delves into the decentralized and uncoordinated nature of emerging CBDC networks, highlighting their likely effects on regulatory convergence, policy diffusion, and the shifting power dynamics among states. China's approach to CBDC is dissected through the lenses of regulatory philosophy, institutional development, and legitimacy, positing that China is selectively reshaping the international financial order. This theme of selective engagement and reshaping recurs in analyses of China's broader economic strategies, such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is characterized by a hub-and-spoke network structure, minimal legalization, and a flexible, project-based use of soft law agreements. Methodologically, these studies employ comparative legal analysis, case studies, and theoretical frameworks like selective reshaping to elucidate China's paradigm shift from adaptation to proactive institution-building. The regulatory challenges of the sharing economy, particularly in ride-hailing, are examined through historical and comparative regulatory approaches, advocating for a greater role for self- and market-based regulation over traditional government intervention. In the domain of free trade agreements (FTAs), the research provides detailed comparative studies of the China-Korea FTA, ChAFTA, TPP, CPTPP, and CETA, using legal and economic assessments, regression analysis, and sectoral case studies to highlight differences in coverage, regulatory disciplines, dispute settlement, and the integration of non-trade concerns. The works also address the challenges of rule development, implementation, and the interplay between FTA and WTO obligations, especially in the context of services and investment liberalization.
